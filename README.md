# Infant Mortality in Asian Countries: A Data-Driven Exploration
## Overview
This project aims to investigate the trends and factors affecting infant mortality rates in Asian countries. By analyzing a diverse dataset containing information on various socio-economic, healthcare, and environmental factors, we seek to gain insights into the key determinants of infant mortality in the region.

## Motivation
Infant mortality is a critical indicator of a nation's healthcare system and social development. Understanding the factors influencing infant mortality can lead to targeted interventions and policy changes to improve child health outcomes. Our goal is to shed light on the complex relationships between different variables and infant mortality rates, enabling evidence-based decision-making for public health initiatives.

## Data Sources
We have collected data from World Bank, a reputable international organizations. The dataset includes annual observations of infant mortality rates and related features for each country in Asia from year 2000-2020. Some of the key features include adolescent birth rates, access to healthcare facilities, sanitation, economic indicators, and more.

## Methodology
- Data Preprocessing: We conducted data cleaning and handling missing values to prepare the dataset for analysis.

- Exploratory Data Analysis: We performed in-depth exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution, trends, and correlations among different features using different data visualization techniques.

- Feature Importance: Using machine learning techniques, such as Random Forests and XGBoost, we determined the most influential factors affecting infant mortality rates.

- Statistical Analysis: We conducted statistical tests, like ANOVA, to compare infant mortality rates across different income groups and regions.

## Key Findings
The infant mortality rates in Asian countries have shown a declining trend over the years, indicating improvements in healthcare and child well-being.

Access to basic sanitation and healthcare services, such as birth attended by health staff, significantly contribute to lower infant mortality rates.

Income group and region play a crucial role in explaining variations in infant mortality rates.

## Conclusion
My comprehensive analysis has revealed valuable insights into the factors impacting infant mortality rates in Asian countries. The project serves as a valuable resource for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers striving to improve child health outcomes in the region.
